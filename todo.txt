1. use the knowledge of block shapes to improve systematic edge orientation
estimation
2. separate left/right profiles (can be used to check if chart is set-up
correctly)
3. improve handling of very small rectangles, especially when roi buffers
overlap
4. make profiles more robust, i.e., resolve reference block orientation
issues
5. fix gui zooming-with-mousewheel
6. Perspective chart can be optimized to keep blocks more aligned with the
meridional direction
