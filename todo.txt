1. add threading to threshold (use opencv integral)
2. make tbb optional (maybe use boost?)
3. use the knowledge of block shapes to improve systematic edge orientation
estimation
4. handle transposing of images (can this be automated?)
5. separate left/right profiles
6. use only vertical mtf values on profiles
7. improve handling of very small rectangles, especially when roi buffers
overlap
8. make profiles more robust, i.e., resolve reference block orientation
issues
