1. use the knowledge of block shapes to improve systematic edge orientation
estimation
2. separate left/right profiles (can be used to check if chart is set-up
correctly)
3. improve handling of very small rectangles, especially when roi buffers
overlap
4. make profiles more robust, i.e., resolve reference block orientation
issues (have not seen problems here in a while ...)
5. fix gui zooming-with-mousewheel
6. Perspective chart can be optimized to keep blocks more aligned with the
meridional direction (this should not really affect overall focus 
position, though)
7. can improve robustness to background objects by measuring the intensity
variance within each block, e.g, comparing to half variance to bottom half
variance and so on. this will weed out non-uniform blocks. (low priority,
unless people really have a lot of background clutter)
8. help screen, link to documentation, etc.
