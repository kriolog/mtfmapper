1. add threading to threshold (at least run gradient and threshold in
parallel)
2. use the knowledge of block shapes to improve systematic edge orientation
estimation
3. separate left/right profiles (can be used to check if chart is set-up
correctly)
4. improve handling of very small rectangles, especially when roi buffers
overlap
5. make profiles more robust, i.e., resolve reference block orientation
issues
6. fix gui zooming-with-mousewheel
