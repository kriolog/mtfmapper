.SH NAME
mtf_generate_test_chart \- generate test charts for evaluating lens sharpness
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mtf_generate_test_chart [-o 
.I <filename>
.B ] [-s 
.I <a4|A4|a3|A3|a2|A2>
.B ] [-t 
.I <perspective|grid>
.B ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mtf_generate_test_chart
generates scalable vector graphics (SVG) files containing test charts for 
evaluating digital camera lens performance (sharpness) as well as autofocus
accuracy / fine-tuning.
.B mtf_generate_test_chart
should be used to generate suitable test charts of use with the
.BR mtf_mapper (1)
tool.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-o <filename>"
Specify output file name
.IP "-s <a4|A4|a3|A3|a2|A2>"
Specify page size of the chart
.IP "-c <perspective|grid>"
Specify chart type. The "perspective" chart is for evaluating autofocus
behaviour, and is intended to be photographed at an angle, typically 45
degrees. The "grid" chart is intended to evaluate lens sharpness across the
focal plane, and should be photographed perpendiculary.
.IP -h
Displays usage information
.SH BUGS
In theory, the perspective chart can be corrected so that the perspective
distortion is cancelled perfectly when the chart is photographed from the
correct distance. This ensures that all the rectanles appear as squares in
the photograph; however, this is not required for 
.BR mtf_mapper (1)
to work correctly. Currently, the perspective distortion and optimal
distance is fixed in the source code.
